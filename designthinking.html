            In my 7th semester, I took up Design Thinking, an interdisciplinary course that was offered by SVKM's architecture college, BSSA. I took it mostly because the curriculum mentioned Objectified, a documentary that I had watched earlier and been very inspired by. I also knew that the course would be mainly practical and project based. I had been missing working with my hands since I had quit my extracurricular activities, so it was fun and refreshing for me.

            Project Brief
          </p>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li> Bring a natural object to class, observe a mechanism that takes place in it and sketch the mechanism</li>
              <li>Work on a small model that demonstrates the mechanism using either paper, wire, elastic, string or cardboard</li>
              <li>Scale up and make a model of a product that implements this mechanism</li>
            </ol>
            Each of these steps were to be implemented without knowledge of the step that follows.

            Phase 1
          </p>
          <p>
            I selected a corn cob and decided to focus on it's protective leaves. It was immediately visible that the leaves were laterally elastic and stretched themselves around the shape of the cob as it grew.
          </p>
          <p>
            The leaf had longitudinally running ridges which gave the leaf structure. The surface of the leaf between these ridges is elastic. The ridges were closer together on the top and bottom of the leaf since these parts required less elasticity.
          </p>

            Phase 2
          </p>
          <p>
            My initial model consisted of cardboard strips held together by elastic. It was a simple model but I felt that it would be more challenging and interesting if I could take an inelastic material and make it elastic.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I selected paper as my material and tried to make it elastic using origami. I researched and came across the herringbone tessellation. It was perfect solution and allowed the paper to be twisted and stretched in different ways.

            Phase 3
          </p>
          <p>
            We were divided into groups to work on this phase and my model was selected to be scaled up. After much contemplation between making a hammock and a one-size-fits-all sleeve, we decided to go ahead with the latter due to feasibility with respect to size.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sleeve is composed of multiple sheets of elastic paper that cohesively shape themselves to the user's body. We experimented with different fold sizes and noticed that the smaller fold sizes gave us more flexibility. So we used sheets with smaller folds on the shoulder to allow for added mobility.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the sleeve itself, we cut out patches of the paper around the outer and inner sides of the elbow. This allowed the user to bend his/her arm at all angles. We made straps out of paper that would go around the user's torso and be attached with a button to fix the sleeve in place.
          </p>

            This project was a great mental exercise in creativity and problem solving. I learned to translate a concept into a tangible product through multiple failed attempts and iterations to reach an acceptable result.
