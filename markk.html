                                hence little content being created on Markk. We took the opportunity to work out some
                                new
                                features and simplify some existing features that could be shipped by the time users
                                started
                                moving out again.

                            These Gurus are our version of influencers. So we wanted to -

                                <li>Introduce the <b>following and followers</b> functionality along with them.</li>

                            Instead of the Live or Archived ratings, we wanted to <b>the Going list</b> (think
                            Bookmarks)
                            on
                            the profile. Going and rating these bookmarked places is the quickest way of earning points.

                            We wanted the profile to look like something that the <b>user could show off</b>, with the

                            Referrals being the currency of their influence on Markk. This was tied to the business

                            are

                            Something that I wanted to keep in mind while designing this screen was to try and show as
                            much
                            of the Live Ratings as I could above the first fold. For this reason, I was doing my best to
                            lay
                            out the profile details on top in as compact a way as possible.
                            <br><br>
                            I also toyed with the idea of surfacing the relevant users who had been viewing a certain
                            Guru’s
                            ratings or some relevant places that a certain Guru has rated before.
                            (eg: “Has rated Malaka Spice, GroundUp and 3 others”)
                        </p>

                            To fix this issue, I created a design that was more along the lines of the existing design. It gave all the profile details more breathing space and a bright yellow background helped differentiate between Guru and non-Guru users easily.

                            I also created a prototype for the scrolling animation for the header collapse. This was heavily inspired by Spotify’s playlist UI.

                            Once these screens were finalised, I moved on to designing the adjacent screens that would open up on Followers, Following, Ratings, as well as empty states for them all.

                            One major flaw that we have in this design is that the buttons on self profile are too narrow and closeby, hence not accessible.
