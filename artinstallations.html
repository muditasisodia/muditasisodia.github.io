            I love working with my hands and making tangible pieces. As a maker at heart, working on art installations in college was one of the most enjoyable and rewarding experiences for me.

            Women's Day, Encatus MPSTME

            March 2017
          </p>

            I had to come up with an interactive installation that celebrated women, our beneficiaries and was aligned to our goals of creating no waste and being as sustainable as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            The dreamcatcher I made had a hula hoop as its circular frame and scrap pieces of cloth tied together to create the inner weave and trailing strands. I used woolen threads to add finer details to the weaving and tried to make the installation as vibrant and colourful as possible. Female beneficiaries and students were asked to write down their dreams and tie them to the trailing strands.

              The dreamcatcher was mounted on a tree so it was visible from a distance but its trailing strands could be reached by visitors.

            As a member of the in-house creatives team, I was tasked to come up with an eye-catching installation for the upcoming Android workshop. I decided to keep it simple and create an anamorphic Android bot on the main staircase in the college lobby in its signature striking green colour.

            Mural at Vile Parle Station

          <p class="proj-subheader">
            October 2016

          <p>
            I had the opportunity to paint my own mural at Vile Parle Station as part of an NGO event. We decided to paint something for the Indian Air Force just in time for 84th Air Force Day. We chose to do this for our team member whose brother was a fighter pilot and was away from home. This mural took us 28 hours to complete. We worked after college till past midnight for a week. We were not too efficient due to lack of experience but for me, it was one of the most rewarding experience yet. Having my work out there for thousands of people to see everyday and maybe evoke a feeling in a few made me very happy.
