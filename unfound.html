        Summer Internship at UnFound

        <p>
          In March 2018, I signed up on AngelList to find myself a front-end web development internship. I applied to <a href="https://unfound.news/" target="_blank">UnFound</a> because the idea of killing misinformation and giving people a holistic perspective on current affairs intrigued me. It was a cause I wanted to be a part of. As my assignment, I was provided a website and asked to replicate it using VueJS or Angular4. I chose to develop with <b>VueJS</b> since I had never worked with a framework before and VueJS has a smoother learning curve than Angular4. I created an almost exact replica of the provided website and was offered the internship.

        </p>
        <p>
          I interned with UnFound for 7 weeks. I was tasked with building the front end of their <b>web app from ground up in React</b>. Having no prior experience in React and no other member on the team to help me out with it, I started familiarising myself with the framework and experimented with it for the first few days.

        </p>

        <p>
          I was provided with low fidelity mockups of the web app. I took the following steps to build the application from scratch:
          <ol>
            <li>Created reusable UI components</li>
            <li>Created page layouts and rendered the UI components with dummy data</li>
            <li>Set up routing with react-router</li>
            <li>Fetched real data from UnFound's APIs</li>
            <li>Configured authentication using Firebase</li>
            <li>Set up basic global state management using Redux</li>
          </ol>
          Throughout this process, I used Bitbucket as directed and saw how version control was implemented in a professional environment.
        </p>

        <p>I completed my internship by handing over a working MVP to UnFound. It was the first time I was able to participate in the professional development process of a product. I observed how they designed the architecture, made techinal design decisions and debugged their code. I saw immense growth in my technical know-how and realised how important it is to surround myself with people more skilled, knowledgable and experienced than me.
        </p>
        <!--
        <p>However, coming out of this internship, I also felt incredibly burnt out. I did not enjoy having to code all day, everyday. I realised that as a front-end developer, I would barely have any say in the UI/UX decisions, something that I find fascinating and would have loved to explore.
        </p>
        <p>
           I felt like maybe the absence of a mentor, and a structured approach to my developement process may have been the reason I found the learning curve so steep and challenging and almost demotivating. I still had my <a href="fendnanodegree.html">Frontend Nanodegree</a> to look forward to so I decided to see how that goes.
